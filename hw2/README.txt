Homework2 Prob 1

The first problem I got into was creating a makefile, never created one before so I had difficulty. I did do some youtube to watch how to do it, but I just checked the layout of the provided makefile in the startvisioncode and copied the outline. I did do a few test to see how it worked and then added some of the code for myself. 

Second problem I faced, was setting the binary value to 1. As I was following the powerpoint, I confused myself that 1 was white, when in reality for the rgb, 1 was black while 255 Is white. Took a while of coding and error testing to figure it out.
